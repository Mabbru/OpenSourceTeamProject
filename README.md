# Object Detection Software using Python and OpenCV

This project aims to develop software for detecting objects within images using Python and OpenCV. It utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model to identify and classify various objects in images in real-time.

## Project Overview

The software identifies various objects such as people, animals, vehicles, etc., within an image and marks their locations with boundary boxes superimposed on the image. This allows users to easily identify important objects within images.

## Features

- **Variety of Objects**: Capable of recognizing over 80 types of objects including people, dogs, and cats.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Immediately detects objects and displays results upon image loading.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes the YOLOv3 model for high rates of recognition.
- **User Convenience**: Executable in a cloud-based environment via Google Colab.
